"""IntentRegistry and built-in intent handlers.

An IntentHandler recognizes one kind of situation from the conversation
context and proposes its "natural" candidate action for it. Handlers are
intentionally optimistic: they are not responsible for validating that
their candidate is *safe* to act on (missing fields, severity mismatches,
out-of-radius dispatch) -- that is the self-critique job of
core/deliberation/constraints.py, run independently by the engine. This
keeps each side simple and means a new intent never has to duplicate
safety logic, and a new constraint never has to know about every intent.

Adding a new intent is a registration (`IntentRegistry.register`), not an
edit to the deliberation engine -- see NFR-2 and the Architecture doc's
extension-points table. No `if/elif` chain over intents lives here or in
the engine; `IntentRegistry.best_match` scores every registered handler
and the highest-confidence match wins.
