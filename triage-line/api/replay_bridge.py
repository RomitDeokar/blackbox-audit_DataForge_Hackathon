"""Demo/replay integration: drive the existing replay harness live.

docs/UI_SPEC.md section 3 gives the UI two WebSocket endpoints: one for a
live call, one for harness runs (`/ws/replay/{run_id}`). Phase 7A has no
real call pipeline yet (that's transport/dialogue, still to be wired to
LiveKit/Deepgram/Groq/Rime), so the only thing that can drive a live event
stream right now is `harness.replay.run_scenario` -- the *exact* decision
code (DeliberationEngine + CommitStateMachine) the eventual live agent
will use, per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "replay harness is a first-class
consumer of core, not a hack."

This module does not reimplement or fork that harness. It only:
  1. looks a scenario up by id from the existing scenario library, and
  2. runs it via the existing `run_scenario(..., on_event=...)` hook,
     relaying each event to WebSocket clients as it happens instead of
     only after the run completes.

`run_scenario` is synchronous (it wraps its own `asyncio.run`), so it is
run in a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread` -- calling it directly from
an async FastAPI request handler would raise ("cannot run the event loop
while another loop is running"). Events produced on that worker thread are
handed back to the request handler's event loop with
`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`, which is the standard, minimal way to
bridge a background thread back into a specific asyncio loop.
